            <br> The Minecraft Fabric server is going to be hosted at <ins>play.kelsoncraft.net</ins> with the
            port 25564
            <br> 
            It can be joined by using "play.kelsoncraft.net:25564" in the tekkit client.
            <br><br>
            I will <ins>never</ins> add any kind of Pay to win aspects, anything in this server can be
            obtained just by playing on it!
            You are welcome to donate once I get that setup but it's entirely optional, it would help with keeping
            the website and game server online.
            <br><br>
            I will be hosting a vanilla/spigot server on <ins>play.kelsoncraft.net:25565</ins> which will
            contain a Survival with an optional plot world or a world which can
            have land claimed using a golden shovel, and a Creative with plots I'm not sure when I'll have it up and running.
