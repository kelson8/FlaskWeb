            <br> The minecraft server is going to be hosted at <ins>play.kelsoncraft.net</ins> with the
            default port (25565),
            it will be a hub server so there will be multiple destinations you can go to, such as Creative
            (Plot world), and Survival (Normal world).
            <br><br>

            I will <ins>never</ins> add any kind of Pay to win aspects, anything in this server can be
            obtained just by playing on it!
            You are welcome to donate once I get that setup but it's entirely optional, it would help with
            buying a host in the future.

            <br><br>
            I will be hosting a fabric server on <ins>play.kelsoncraft.net:25564</ins> which will
            contain the KelsonCraft 1.20 Fabric pack, I'm not sure when I'll have it up and running.
