                  I will probably get a wordpress or something up and running on this webite in the future.
                  Possibly a forum.

                  I might start hosting a minecraft server and a fivem server on my network, I eventually want to get
                  the FiveM server up and running with some of the scripts that I have created and put together.

          <p class="col-md-8 fs-6">Here's a little bit about myself, my name is Kelson and my username is usually
            kelson8.
            I've always been passionate about tech especially computer hardware, Minecraft coding for spigot is what
            originally got me into programming.
            <br> I have a small spigot plugin that I occasionally add features to, currently one of the noteable
            features is the localchat.
            <br>
            <br> I recently really started getting into playing around with javascript. and I've enjoyed that.
            <br>
            <br>I've been learning a lot with nodejs and javascript in the browser, I'm not great at it though.
