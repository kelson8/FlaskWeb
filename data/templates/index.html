      <p id="main_headers"> Welcome to the KelsonCraft Flask website. </p>
        <p> I will be hosting some projects here, possibly a WordPress, maybe a MTA SA server for GTA SA
        <br>
        This website will have a forum hosted at forum.kelsoncraft.net in the future, I don't have it up and running yet though.
        <br><br>
        My website has a gitea server hosted on my alternative domain here:

        <h1 id="main_headers"> About me and what I have been up to </h1>
        <br>
        <p> I have decided not to pursue making a Minecraft or FiveM server for now, at least a public one. I may just keep the servers
          private between my friends and whoever wants to join it.
          <br>
          I have been working on learning more coding with Godot the game engine using GDScript and C#, the server stuff is fun but
          I just don't have the time to dedicate to doing it full time like I want and don't feel like messing with the servers.
          <br><br>
          Also I am learning way more stuff to do with Linux Administration and Windows Administration, networking, firewalls, and all kinds of
          stuff, I've been making projects with Raspberry Pi Picos.
          <br><br>
          I have a Raspberry Pi Pico running a IR Receiver for a remote, button #1 turns my bedroom lamp on, button #4 turns the lamp off.
          I am using Home Assistant for the main part of it, and ESPHome on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
          <br><br>
          Learning this stuff has helped me become the person I used to be really be, the techy side of me is really starting to show again.

          <br><br>
          I may post pictures of my projects in the future when I feel like it, eventually I will also publish the code 
          and guides on how I am doing a lot of this stuff.
